# Julia Floating-Point Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Julia related to floating-point comparisons and the ternary operator. The bug manifests when comparing floating-point numbers very close to zero, leading to unexpected results.

## Bug Description
The issue involves the comparison of floating-point numbers near zero in the context of a ternary operator. Due to the inherent limitations of floating-point precision, comparisons that should theoretically evaluate to true may incorrectly evaluate to false, causing unexpected branching in the code.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.jl` file using a Julia interpreter.
3. Observe the unexpected output for cases where numbers very close to zero are compared.

## Solution
The provided `bugSolution.jl` demonstrates a solution that handles the comparison with a tolerance to account for floating-point imprecision. This prevents the unexpected branching and ensures correct behavior.
